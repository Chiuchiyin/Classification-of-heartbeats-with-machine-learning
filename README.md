# Classification of heartbeats with machine learning
This repository is intended as extension of my previous project [Heartbeat ECG Classification](https://github.com/Chiuchiyin/Heartbeat-ECG-Classification) which I did for university assignment. I have also included the work in [this repository](https://github.com/Chiuchiyin/Classification-of-heartbeats-with-machine-learning/tree/main/Original%20work) for your convenience.

# Work Plan
The original project uses [Segmented and Preprocessed dataset from MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shayanfazeli/heartbeat/data?select=mitbih_test.csv). The algorithm used were KNN, Random Forest, Gradient Boost and SVM.

While the resulting models are rather impressive, I would like to explore the possibility of building better models. What I plan to do includes:
1. Building deep learning model
2. Generating synthetic data with GAN
3. Building models with synthetic data
4. Process the raw data myself
5. Include other data sources such as Fantasia
